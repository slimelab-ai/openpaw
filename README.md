# openclaw-workspace (workspace-only branch)

This branch intentionally contains **only** the OpenClaw workspace prompt files.

- Source of truth for these files: `workspace/`
- Upstream templates live in `openclaw/openclaw` under `docs/reference/templates/`

Use this branch when you want a repo that cleanly maps onto an agent workspace directory.

If you want to pull upstream OpenClaw code changes, use the `main` branch (which remains a normal fork of `openclaw/openclaw`).
